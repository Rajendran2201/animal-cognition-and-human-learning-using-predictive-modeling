# Interdisciplinary Impact on Animal Cognition and Human Learning Strategies using Predictive Modeling


## Introduction

The paper explores the cognitive relationship between great apes and humans, aiming to understand shared evolutionary origins. It discusses historical studies demonstrating problem-solving abilities and communication skills in apes, alongside recent neuroscience techniques highlighting similarities in brain structure and function between apes and humans. The interdisciplinary approach spans cognitive psychology, neuroscience, ethology, anthropology, and comparative biology to address research gaps in understanding cognitive evolution.

## Methodology

### Defining Research Objectives and Data Collection
- Collect behavioral, neurological, and genetic data from captive ape populations and human participants.
### Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Handle missing data, duplicate data, and outliers through various methods such as imputation and dropping.
### Data Standardization
- Split the data into training and test sets for model development.
### Machine Learning Model Selection and Model Training
- Utilize algorithms such as K-Means, Prophet, Random Forest, and Convolutional Neural Networks for clustering and forecasting.
### Artificial Intelligence for Analysis
- Apply AI techniques like natural language processing and computer vision for data analysis and insights extraction.

## Results

The investigation yields multifaceted insights across diverse domains, including cognitive mechanisms, evolutionary perspectives on behavior, advances in artificial intelligence, neuroscience, mental health, and personalized learning. The study underscores the imperative of delving deeper into the origins and interconnections of cognitive processes to advance our comprehension of cognition across species.
